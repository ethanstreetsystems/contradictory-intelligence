# Phase 1: Product Architecture and Initial Data Sources

## 1. Golden Path MVP
Ingest → Normalize → Store → Display

Goal: prove the system can automatically collect market information and show it in one place.

Define what Phase 1 includes and excludes.

## 2. Initial Data Sources
## Initial Data Sources

The initial sources for Phase 1 are selected based on two criteria:
1. They are part of the founder’s real research workflow
2. They can be accessed via RSS or structured web feeds

These sources focus on emerging technology, venture capital, and future-oriented investment themes.

### 1. Peter Diamandis Newsletter

Type: Newsletter
Access Method: RSS
Reason: Future technology trends, longevity, AI, space, and exponential technologies.

### 2. ARK Invest Research

## 3. Standard Data Format
Define the standard object every item becomes.

All sources will be converted into one standard format so they can be stored and displayed consistently.

Draft fields:

- id
- source_name
- title
- author
- published_date
- url
- raw_text
- summary (optional)
- tags (optional)

This format may change after reviewing the actual data from the selected sources.

---

## 4. Architecture + Stack
Define the core technology choices.

Example:
- Backend
- Database
- Frontend
- Job scheduler

Define how the system components interact.

---

## 5. Ingestion + Normalization
For each source define:
- how data is fetched
- how content is parsed
- deduplication logic
- error handling
- how ingestion state is tracked

---

## 6. Storage + Retrieval
Define:
- database structure
- how items are stored
- how the feed is queried
- indexes or keys for speed and deduplication

---

## 7. Minimal UI Screens
Define the basic interface.

Example:
- feed page (latest items)
- item detail page
- filters or search (optional)

---

## 8. Minimal AI Enrichment (Optional)
Decide whether Phase 1 includes:
- summaries
- tags
- ticker extraction

If included, define exactly what gets generated.

---

## 9. Deployment + Environment
Define:
- where the system runs
- how jobs are scheduled
- API key / secret management

---

## 10. Phase 1 Success Criteria
Define what “done” means.

Examples:
- items ingest automatically
- no duplicate records
- feed displays correctly
- links work
- data matches original sources
